         Mini Bios: Edith Falco,
         called Edie,
         was born on July 5,
         1963 in Brooklyn,
         New York,
         to Judith Anderson,
         an actress,
         and Frank Falco,
         a jazz drummer. She is of Italian (father) and Swedish,
         English,
         and Cornish (mother) descent. Edie grew up on Long Island and attended SUNY Purchase,
         where she was trained in acting at the prestigious Conservatory of Theatre Arts and Film. She moved to Manhattan after graduation,
         auditioning for roles and supporting herself as best she could; for example,
         working parties for an entertainment company where she would wear a Cookie Monster costume and urge people to get on the dance floor. Falco began getting film roles,
         mostly smaller supporting parts,
         starting in the late 1980s. Her first notable role was a supporting part in Bullets Over Broadway (1994).\\n\\nIronically,
         it was in television where the conservatory-trained Falco's career first flowered. She obtained her first recurring roles in 1993,
         on the acclaimed police dramas Homicide: Life on the Street (1993),
         as the wife of a blinded police officer,
         and Law & Order (1990) as a Legal Aid attorney. Next came a recurring role on the prison drama Oz (1997),
         as a sympathetic corrections officer. All the while she continued to work in film,
         still in small supporting roles.\\n\\nSupporting herself in acting continued to be a challenge until at last Falco found success in 1999,
         when she was cast in the HBO series The Sopranos (1999),
         as Carmela,
         the wife of New Jersey Mafia street boss Tony Soprano. \\,
